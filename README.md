 * Most compilers break down into three primary stages: Parsing, Transformation,
 * and Code Generation
 *
 * 1. *Parsing* is taking raw code and turning it into a more abstract
 *    representation of the code.
 *
 * 2. *Transformation* takes this abstract representation and manipulates to do
 *    whatever the compiler wants it to.
 *
 * 3. *Code Generation* takes the transformed representation of the code and
 *    turns it into new code.
